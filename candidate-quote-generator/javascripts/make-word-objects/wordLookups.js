//The original dictionary I tried to use, which was supposed to match each word to a part of speech, had over 270k entries — many of them inaccurate. That made it too clunky to deal with in here.

//Instead, starting with a list of the 5000 most common words in English, I built my own dictionary. Using this as a starting point, the program (in the "makeWordObjects.js" file) will automatically check for new/unrecognized words every time I scrape Twitter. The unrecognized words will be logged to the console, and from there I can choose to either (1) add them to the dictionary (with their part of speech), (2) add them to the corrections list (if they're already in the dictionary and are only misspellings/tense differences), or (3) add them to the list of words to remove.
var miniDictionary, corrections, removals;

//Array of acceptable words with their part of speech.
